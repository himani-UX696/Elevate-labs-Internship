On home screen, I added icons for delivery address and the search bar, for quick scanning i added popular food items at the very top so that users can order them right away. Below this are the list of restaurants, on which users can click and visit the particular restaurant. On menu page, I added restaurant images at the top , followed by categories and available list of items, when user click the "add to cart" cta, it will be added to the cart section. On this page, along with item , i displayed order amount and payment details, and added proceed to pay button. On the order confirmation page, I added info like order id, order details, estimated delivery time, track your order and explore features.
