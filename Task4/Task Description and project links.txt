Problems identified:
1. Lack of alignment and consistent spacing: Uneven section placement and irregular spacing led to a cluttered and unbalanced layout.
2. Outdated & Low-Quality Images: The visuals lacked appeal and did not reflect the brandâ€™s quality, reducing user engagement.
3. Weak  and insignificant Visual Hierarchy: Key information did not stand out, making navigation and content scanning difficult for users.
4. Ineffective Use of Negative Space: While spacing lacked intent. Equal gaps between all elements made it hard to distinguish related content and weakened hierarchy.
5. Limited Product Discovery and customization: The absence of search, filter, and sorting options restricted users from easily finding or refining products, reducing browsing convenience.


Solutions opted:
1. Consistent Layout: Ensured proper alignment and spacing for a balanced design.
2. Meaningful Content Structure: Organized text and visuals to create clear relationships between elements.
3. Improved Visual Hierarchy:  Applied optimal colors and typography to highlight key information.
4. Better Product Discovery: Added customization like search bar, my location, profile, and few filter options.
5. Thoughtful Homepage Flow:  Re-arranged sections to guide users smoothly and highlight important content.
