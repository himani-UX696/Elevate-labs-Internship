I selected a teal green as a primary color which I have used for the button CTAs. Then I used  a lighter shade of teal green for the background ensuring proper contrast and visibility. The font style is poppins which is modern, elegant and provides enough readability. I have chosen different weights for this font for example semibold, medium, regular ensuring visual hierarchy and it become easy to scan the content of the screen based upon its importance.
